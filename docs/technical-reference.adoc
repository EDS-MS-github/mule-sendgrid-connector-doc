[[Config]]
=== Config


Default configuration


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Connection a| <<Config_Connection, Basic Authentication>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Read Timeout a| Number |  Time in seconds to wait for the response. 0 means infinite |  0 | {nbsp}
| Read Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit to be used in the readTimeoutTimeout configurations |  SECONDS | {nbsp}
| Name a| String |  The identifier of this element used to reference it in other components |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit. |  | {nbsp}
|===

==== Connection Types
[[Config_Connection]]
===== Connection


This class (as it's name implies) provides connection instances and the functionality to disconnect and validate those connections. All connection related parameters (values required in order to create a connection) must be declared in the connection providers. This particular example is a PoolingConnectionProvider which declares that connections resolved by this provider will be pooled and reused. There are other implementations like CachedConnectionProvider which lazily creates and caches connections or simply ConnectionProvider if you want a new connection each time something requires one.


====== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Protocol a| Enumeration, one of:

** HTTP
** HTTPS |  Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP and HTTPS. \nDefault value is HTTP. When using HTTPS the HTTP communication is going to be secured using TLS / SSL. \nIf HTTPS was configured as protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the tls:context child element of this listener-config. |  HTTP | {nbsp}
| Base Uri a| String |  base URI of SendGrid API |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Api Key a| String |  apiKey to access SendGrid API |  | *x*{nbsp}
| TLS Configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Reference to a TLS config element. This will enable HTTPS for this config |  | {nbsp}
| Proxy Configuration a| <<Default>> |  Proxy connection configuration. |  | {nbsp}
| Connection Timeout a| Number |  The timeout for establishing connections to the remote service. This attribute works in tandem with #connectionTimeoutUnit. |  30 | {nbsp}
| Connection Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  A TimeUnit that qualifies the #connectionTimeout |  SECONDS | {nbsp}
| Use Persistent Connections a| Boolean |  If false, each connection will be closed after the first request is completed. |  true | {nbsp}
| Max Connections a| Number |  The maximum number of outbound connection that will be kept open at the same time. By default the number of connection is unlimited. |  -1 | {nbsp}
| Connection Idle Timeout a| Number |  The time that a connection can remain idle before it is closed. The value of this attribute is only used when persistent connection are enabled.This attribute works in tandem with #connectionIdleTimeoutUnit |  30 | {nbsp}
| Connection Idle Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  A TimeUnit that qualifies the #connectionIdleTimeout |  SECONDS | {nbsp}
| Stream Response a| Boolean |  Whether or not received responses should be streamed, meaning processing will continue as soon as all headers are parsed and the body streamed as it arrives. When enabled, the response MUST be eventually read since depending on the configured buffer size it may not fit into memory and processing will stop until space is available. |  false | {nbsp}
| Response Buffer Size a| Number |  The space in bytes for the buffer where the HTTP response will be stored. |  -1 | {nbsp}
| Cache Control a| String |  The Cache control strategy. |  no-cache | {nbsp}
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment will fail if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy |  | {nbsp}
